Neutrino Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks


This file is a quick, technical walkthrough of the final project 'Neutrino Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks' by Peter Bagnegaard and Rasmus F. Ørsøe as part of the Big Data course at NBI 2020. 

Note: To run these python files you'll need the 120000.db, 140000.db and 160000.db source data files, which are NOT included in this github repo.
